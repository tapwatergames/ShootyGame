# Summary 
CrispGodotTemplate is a project that is meant to be project that melds the crisp-game-lib with godot https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib

The intention is that users will have a template that easily allows for the creation and deployment of small projects to the web. If you want an additional limitation that forces you to create small projects, try only using the limitation of only using one scene and one script!


- add input stuff that can be used in physics not just signals
